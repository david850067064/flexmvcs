1.1 - Repackaged zip and updated inline docs

1.2 - Removed old files that were inadvertently included.

1.3 - Obviated the need for AbstractProxy and AbstractMediator in applications:
         * Implemented sendNotification convenience method in Proxy and Mediator
         * Added protected facade:Ifacade property initialized to Facade.getInstance()
           on both Mediator and Proxy. The concrete Facade must be instantiated 
           first, but this call will return the concrete instance, even though the
           framework Facade.getInstance is called. 
           
1.4 - Added INotifier interface and Notifier class. MacroCommand, Command, Mediator
      and Proxy all extend Notifier and implement INotifier. The sendNotification
      method in Proxy and Mediator was moved to Notifier and is now available to
      Commands. Also the protected facade property was moved from Proxy and Mediator
      into Notifier, so Commands now get the facade reference at construction time.
      
1.5 - Amended removeMediator method to remove associated Observer references from
      the observerMap. When a notificationName's observer list length falls to zero
      the reference to the observer list is also removed. Added compareNotifyContext
      method to the Observer class and IObserver interface, which compares a given 
      object to the Observer's notification context and returns a Boolean indicating
      their equality. This allows the View to  compare the Mediator being removed with 
      the Observer's notification context without breaking the Observer's encapsulation.
      
1.6 - The 1.5 removeMediator implementation created a new situation where after an 
      observerMap array was nulled due to its length falling to zero. subsequent calls 
      to removeMediator could throw an exception. This was because the method of removing
      the only reference to the array was setting the observerMap value to null for the
      observerMap key in question. This method was used since Adobe's 'Programming 
      ActionScript 3.0  > Core ActionScript 3.0 Data Types and Classes > Working with 
      Arrays' says: "You may come across code that uses the delete operator on an array 
      element. The delete operator sets the value of an array element to undefined, but 
      it does not remove the element from the array". However, this proves to no longer
      be the case. So now, the delete operator is used to remove both observerMap and 
      mediatorMap entries.
